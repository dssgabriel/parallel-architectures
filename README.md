# Parallel Architectures

This module is part of the first semester of the High Performance Computing and Simulation master's degree of University Paris-Saclay.

## Introduction
The goal of this class is to discover the organization and the inner workings of parallel architectures, as well as their key features, more specifically:
- Taxonomy of parallel architectures
- SIMD/vector architectures
- Shared memory vs. Distributed memory
- Interconnection networks
- Cache coherence
- Operating Systems and runtimes for parallel computers

## Labs
This repository contains the source code for the two main projects we worked on this semester: optimizing an N-body simulation in both 2D and 3D.
